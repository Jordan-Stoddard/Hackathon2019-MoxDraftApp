Mock NFL drafts

This app was built in approximately 30 hours during the Lambda School Winter Hackathon.

It was incredibly fun. For me at the 3 month mark of experience as a web developer, I had always felt like my javascript logic and functionality skills could use a boost, but I was involved in about 99% of the functionality of the app, and absolutely carried my own weight in that regard, so that gave me a huge confidence boost in my own skills. Working in a collaborative environment like this was really fun, we worked well together, managed our time really smoothly, prevented scope creep, each worked on the areas that were our strengths. Was just an amazing experience.

Our team consisted of members with:
3 weeks,
6 weeks,
3 months, (me)
3 months,
6 months

of experience collectively.

App was built using React v 16.7, Bootstrap, https://react-table.js.org/, CSS.
